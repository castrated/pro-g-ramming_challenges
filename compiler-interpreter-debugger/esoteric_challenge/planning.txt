PLAN NOTES FOR NEW ESOTERIC LANGUAGE
===========================================

<> CHALLENGE REQUIREMENTS <>
-------------------------------------------
0. Must be original
1. Must work on an electronic computer
2. Must be a working language
3. Must have examples of practicality

<> NOTES <>
-------------------------------------------
- language will be named "PortaLang"
  >> portmanteau of "portal" & "lang"
- language will be functional
- language will rely on encryption
- encryption of source is compilation

<> ENCRYPTION METHOD <>
-------------------------------------------
- UTF-8 ID (A/N) will be the ID per char
  >> "$" will have ID 0024
  >> "Âµ" will have ID 00B5
- encryption will require "seed" to compile
  >> different seeds output other programs
  >> input 4 with seed 8 will output 
     something other than i4s7
  >> infinite amount of programs possible
  >> duplicate programs are psosible with
     unique seed/source combinations
