# pro-g-ramming_challenges

Doing all the pro/g/ramming challenges here. For reference: ![pro/g/ramming challenges](https://imgur.com/OQ6B6ir.png)

I'll do each challenge in any language I see fit, and in no particular order.

Filename formatting will include the number of the problem, the name of the problem, and the language the problem was solved in.

I'll try and do at least one problem per day.
